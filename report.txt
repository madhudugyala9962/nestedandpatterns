# Report on Pattern Printing Program
# ----------------------------------

# Approach:
# I divided the problem into three separate functions:
# 1. print_square(size) - prints a square of asterisks using nested loops.
# 2. print_triangle(height) - prints a right-angled triangle with numbers.
# 3. print_pyramid(height) - prints a pyramid of asterisks using spaces and stars.

# Each function uses nested loops:
# - Outer loop controls rows.
# - Inner loop controls columns or characters in each row.

# Challenges:
# 1. Aligning the pyramid correctly required careful handling of spaces.
# 2. Ensuring numbers in the triangle reset correctly for each row.
# 3. Making the program flexible for different input sizes.

# Solutions:
# - Used (height - i - 1) spaces before stars in the pyramid.
# - Printed numbers from 1 to i for each row in the triangle.
# - Tested with multiple sizes (3, 5, 7) to confirm correctness.

# Verification:
# I tested the program with different input sizes:
# - Square: size=3, 5, 7
# - Triangle: height=4, 6
# - Pyramid: height=3, 5, 7
# All outputs matched the expected patterns.

# Conclusion:
# The program is robust, modular, and well-documented. Each function can be reused independently, and the main block demonstrates correctness with sample inputs.
